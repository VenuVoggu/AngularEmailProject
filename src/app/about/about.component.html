      Gmail is a free email service provided by Google. As of 2019, it had 1.5 billion 
      active users worldwide.[1] A user typically accesses Gmail in a web browser or the 
      official mobile app. Google also supports the use of email clients via the POP and 
      IMAP protocols.

      At its launch in 2004, Gmail provided a storage capacity of one gigabyte per user, 
      which was significantly higher than its competitors offered at the time. Today, the service 
      comes with 15 gigabytes of storage. Users can receive emails up to 50 megabytes in size, 
      including attachments, while they can send emails up to 25 megabytes. In order to send larger 
      files, users can insert files from Google Drive into the message. Gmail has a search-oriented 
      interface and a "conversation view" similar to an Internet forum. The service is notable among 
      website developers for its early adoption of Ajax.

      Google's mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes, including to filter 
      spam and malware, and to add context-sensitive advertisements next to emails. This advertising 
      practice has been significantly criticized by privacy advocates due to concerns over unlimited 
      data retention, ease of monitoring by third parties, users of other email providers not having 
      agreed to the policy upon sending emails to Gmail addresses, and the potential for Google to 
      change its policies to further decrease privacy by combining information with other Google data 
      usage. The company has been the subject of lawsuits concerning the issues. Google has stated
       that email users must "necessarily expect" their emails to be subject to automated processing 
       and claims that the service refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages,
        such as those mentioning race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or financial statements.
         In June 2017, Google announced the end to the use of contextual Gmail content for advertising 
         purposes, relying instead on data gathered from the use of its other services.
